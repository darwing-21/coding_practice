# **Daily Coding Challenges**

## **Overview**

This project is a collection of daily coding challenges designed to reinforce my problem-solving skills in Java. Each
day, I solve a new problem and implement the solution in a separate Java class.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA

## **Project Structure**

Each challenge is implemented in its own class, with a corresponding `main` method to execute the solution. The classes
are named according to the challenge they solve, and they are organized by week and day for easy reference.

## **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Navigate to the class of the challenge you want to run.
4. Execute the `main` method in the class to see the solution in action.

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to continuously improve my programming skills by tackling different types of problems,
ranging from string manipulation to mathematical computations and data structure challenges.
